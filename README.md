Flask Project 1006
Name: Shilpita Mitra-Behura
UNI: sm4808
For this project, I made a homepage and added three links. The first link was to
my favorite website (even though this really isn't my favorite website because who really has
a favorite website.)
The other two links were to two different rank style pages, one about Columbia libraries
and one about the Youtube channel Bon Appetit.
I took images from online and uploaded them to the pages. All the images can be found in the
static folder. I used tables on both pages, utilizing a little bit of CSS to format the table
borders the way I wanted them.
